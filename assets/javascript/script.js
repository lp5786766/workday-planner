// When I open the page, today's date is displayed (Moment.js library).
// Below I see 9 blocks of 1 hour each (9:00 am - 5:00 pm);
    // This should be covered in the HTML file.
        // time---task-field---task---saveBtn
// Each block has functionality:
    // 1. I can click on the block the record my task. 
    // After I input text, I click the save button to the side of the block and the task persits.
    // *****************************************************SAVE BUTTON*************************************************************
    // saveBtn on.("click"). How to distinguish between buttons?

    // The text is stored in the local storage.
    // input="text";
    // The text is taken from the local storage for display.
    // Text could be deleted from the local storage.
    // 
    // 2. I can click on the existing task and erase it, I can write a new task on the same spot and save it afterwards.
    // 3. Each block is colored respective of time (past, current, future event);


// Questions/Suggestions:
    // Would the tasks be deleted the next day and you are presented with a blank day?
    // Mayby add button "Clear all Tasks"
    // Maybe add options to highlight events or timeblocks.
    //
